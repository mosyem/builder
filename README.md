# Documentation

### Customizing the page builder

I have separated all the logic for manipulating the HTML elements into its own Designer class, which can be found at the path: `src/composables/Designer.js`.

Customizing the page builder is made simple since all the logic resides in the Designer Class.

### Unsplash

Please note that if you want to use Unsplash, simply create an .env file in your root folder and enter your Unsplash API key and value.

Example: VITE_UNSPLASH_KEY="your-unsplash-api-key-here"

# Use with Backend

The Page builder's capabilities become infinite when integrated with a backend framework like Laravel or Express.js.

If you are familiar with Laravel, you can integrate the page builder with my open-source Laravel Admin Panel available at:
[Demo & repo](https://github.com/qaiswardag/myissue-admin).

By utilizing a backend Framework, the HTML components, currently stored in a JSON file at `public/components.json`, can be easily stored in the database, resulting in better management of HTML components.
